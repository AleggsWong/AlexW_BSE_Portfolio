# Final Milestone
# Second Milestone
# First Milestone
For your first milestone, describe what your project is and how you plan to build it. You can include:
- An explanation about the different components of your project and how they will all integrate together
- Technical progress you've made so far
- Challenges you're facing and solving in your future milestones
- What your plan is to complete your project

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser.

The project consists of an RGB LED, board, and three switches each corresponding to RGB (red, green, blue) values. Sliding the swtches up and down controls the intensity of each color on the LED, which allows the LED to display a gradient of colors. The three switches and LED shown are soldered on the back, and the longest pin of the LED is slotted into the hole with a - sign indicated. I ran into trouble soldering the LED because I didn't push the LED flush with the board before soldering, so it was stuck in a raised position. However, I learned that didn't matter because current could still flow to the LED.
